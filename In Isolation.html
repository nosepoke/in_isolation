But there&#39;s something about them that makes you feel good, and you want to take that feeling with you.

You head for the door to [[the hallway|Run for the pods 2]], shoes in hand.
&lt;&lt;silently&gt;&gt;&lt;&lt;set $object to &quot;sneakers&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;&lt;/silently&gt;&gt;</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="50" name="hiking boots" tags="Room Red Timer Inventory" position="2143,1769" size="100,100">You hold one boot in each hand. They&#39;re heavy, but practical. If you end up having an &quot;emergency landing&quot; on the planet below, these should serve you well.

[[You head for the door|Run for the pods 2]].
&lt;&lt;silently&gt;&gt;&lt;&lt;set $object to &quot;boots&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;&lt;/silently&gt;&gt;</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="51" name="Follow the arrows" tags="Hallway Red Timer Inventory" position="1256,2856" size="200,200">You start running in the direction of the arrows. 

&lt;&lt;if $object eq &quot;poster&quot;&gt;&gt;The poster is large and awkward. It catches on the walls sometimes. By the time you get to the next turn, the edges of the poster are bent and torn in a few spots.
	&lt;&lt;elseif $object eq &quot;handheld&quot;&gt;&gt;The weight of your handheld tugs at your pocket while you run. 
	&lt;&lt;elseif $object eq &quot;photos&quot;&gt;&gt;The picture frames clink together with each step you take. You worry that they&#39;ll break, so you press them together even tighter.
	&lt;&lt;elseif $object eq &quot;pillows&quot;&gt;&gt;It&#39;s hard to figure out how to run with pillows. You try a few different methods—hugging them against your chest, clutching one in each hand—but they flop around while you run, making it hard to see. Eventually you shove one pillow under each arm and plow your way down the hallway like a linebacker.
	
	&lt;&lt;elseif $object eq &quot;tshirt&quot;&gt;&gt;You hold your roommate&#39;s dragon t-shirt like a flag, and it billows out behind you while you run.
	&lt;&lt;elseif $object eq &quot;seedbox&quot;&gt;&gt;The contents of the black box shift with each step you take, making strange hissing sounds. 
	
	&lt;&lt;elseif $object eq &quot;fatigues&quot;&gt;&gt;Your fatigues are bundled into a loose ball that you clutch in one hand. As you run, you realize the left pant leg has a stain on it the size of a tennis ball. When was the last time you washed these?
	&lt;&lt;elseif $object eq &quot;sweatshirt&quot;&gt;&gt;Your hand closes tightly around your sweatshirt. Its familiar softness reassures you.
	&lt;&lt;elseif $object eq &quot;rifle&quot;&gt;&gt;You hold the rifle with both hands as if you were running into battle. 
	&lt;&lt;elseif $object eq &quot;handgun&quot;&gt;&gt;You&#39;re glad you took the time to put the holster on. Now you have both hands free, and you can run even faster.
	&lt;&lt;elseif $object eq &quot;multitool&quot;&gt;&gt;The weight of the multi-tool tugs at your pocket while you run. You slow for a second to tighten the drawstring. Can&#39;t have your pants falling to your ankles while you try to escape.
	
	&lt;&lt;elseif $object eq &quot;toothbrush&quot;&gt;&gt;You feel a small cold wetness crawl across the side of your thigh. Apparently your toothbrush was still a bit damp from when you used it last night. Now your pocket smells like spearmint.
	&lt;&lt;elseif $object eq &quot;shampoo&quot;&gt;&gt;The shampoo bottle breathes wafts of citrus scent into the air. It&#39;s a delicate smell that feels totally out of place in this situation. For that reason, you&#39;re glad that you noticed it.
	
	&lt;&lt;elseif $object eq &quot;boots&quot;&gt;&gt;You hold a boot in each hand. They&#39;re damned heavy. You really hope they&#39;ll be useful later.
	&lt;&lt;elseif $object eq &quot;sneakers&quot;&gt;&gt;You hold one red shoe in each hand. They look especially vibrant in the angry glare of the alert lights.
	
	&lt;&lt;elseif $object eq &quot;oldbooks&quot;&gt;&gt;You&#39;ve only been running for a few seconds and already you&#39;re breathing hard. These old books are big and clunky. The corners poke at your ribs. Maybe you don&#39;t have to bring all six volumes...but then again, you don&#39;t have time to sit and think about //which// of the six volumes you&#39;d leave behind. 
	&lt;&lt;elseif $object eq &quot;handbook&quot;&gt;&gt;The wine sloshes around in the bottle.
	&lt;&lt;elseif $object eq &quot;gerbilgame&quot;&gt;&gt;The wine sloshes around in the bottle.
	
	&lt;&lt;elseif $object eq &quot;nothing&quot;&gt;&gt;You hold your arms out for balance in the flickering light.
&lt;&lt;/if&gt;&gt;
There&#39;s a T-shaped intersection. If you kept going straight, you&#39;d end up in the engine room—probably the last place you&#39;d want to be at this moment. 

[[The arrows point left]].</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="52" name="The arrows point left" tags="Hallway Red Timer Inventory" position="1095,3082" size="100,100">You round the corner as fast as you can. At the far end of the hallway, you see a little alcove with a row of circular hatches on the wall.

[[The escape pods]]!</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="53" name="The escape pods" tags="Hallway Red Timer Inventory" position="1098,3218" size="100,100">Faster! You practically fly down the hallway.

Behind you comes the sound of something breaking. Metal twisting, snapping.

Don&#39;t look! [[Just go]]!</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="54" name="Just go" tags="Hallway Red Timer Inventory" position="1098,3368" size="100,100">You reach the alcove, breathing hard.

The first hatch is locked. The escape pod has already been deployed.

You try the second hatch. Locked. So are the third, fourth, and fifth hatches.

Your hand closes on the handle for the [[final hatch]].</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="55" name="final hatch" tags="Inventory White" position="1098,3518" size="100,100">It opens, revealing a small cockpit dimly lit in white light. You climb inside and close the hatch behind you.

The escape pod hums to life, lights brightening and displays blurring with data. One screen lists the crew roster, with little green icons showing who has been successfully evacuated.

You&#39;re the last one to leave.

[[Good. Everyone else is safe.|Strap in]]
[[No one waited for me? Assholes!|Strap in]]



</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="56" name="Strap in" tags="White Timer Inventory" position="1098,3668" size="100,100">Well, no reason to wait any longer.

You slip into an environmental suit just in case things go sideways. Then you strap yourself into one of the pod&#39;s two seats and set OBJECT on your lap.

There&#39;s a large button on the instrument panel.

[[LAUNCH]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="57" name="LAUNCH" tags="White Inventory" position="1098,3818" size="100,100">You&#39;re pressed back into the seat as the pod tears away from the ship. The intense acceleration makes it hard to think. Hard to keep track of time. Hard to breathe...

Then, weightlessness. Zero-gravity.

You can breathe again. 

[[You made it]]. 

</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="58" name="You made it" tags="White Inventory" position="1098,3968" size="100,100">There&#39;s a viewscreen in front of you. You want to see what&#39;s happening outside. 

You press the button that activates the viewscreen. 

It shows...

The ship, [[breaking apart]].
The other escape pods, little [[dots of light]].
The planet below, [[green and golden]].</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="59" name="breaking apart" tags="" position="912,4084" size="100,100">Fire shows through cracks in the hull. Suddenly, a silvery cloud rushes from the dying ship. It must be the air supply. Starved of oxygen, the flames die. The ship slowly breaks apart into thousands of pieces. Everything happens in eerie silence.

You let go of OBJECT and let it float across the viewscreen. Should you have chosen chosen something else to take with you?

Maybe.

But there are reasons you chose to bring it along. Maybe it&#39;ll help you survive. Maybe it&#39;ll help you stay...yourself. There&#39;s no way to know for certain what your future holds. 

The only thing you can do is [[meet it]].</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="60" name="dots of light" tags="" position="1107,4126" size="100,100">You see the other five escape pods spread out in a line. You&#39;re close, but the dark expanse of space makes the other pods seem tiny.

The escape pod has a communications array. The others will contact you soon. For now, you decide to catch your breath.

You made it this far. What next?
